# 🔄 Overriding in Python

In Python, **overriding** allows a subclass (child class) to provide a specific implementation of methods or variables already defined in a superclass (parent class).

---

## ✅ Overriding Methods

- Subclasses can redefine methods inherited from a parent class.
- The subclass version overrides the parent version when called on a subclass object.
- Useful for customizing or extending base behavior.
- You can use `super()` to call the original method from the parent class if needed.

---

## ✅ Overriding Variables

- Variables defined in the subclass with the same name as in the parent class will override the parent’s version.
- This can apply to both class-level and instance-level variables.
- Allows subclasses to modify inherited data as needed.

---

## ⚙️ Best Practices

- Use `super()` to maintain a connection with the parent class, especially in constructors and method extensions.
- Override only when necessary to avoid confusion or redundancy.
- Overriding is a key part of **polymorphism**, allowing different classes to define different behaviors for the same method name.
