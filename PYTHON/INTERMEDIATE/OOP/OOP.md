## `Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python`

- Object-Oriented Programming `(OOP)` is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects that contain both data (`attributes`) and behaviors (`methods`).

`Objects, Methods, and Attributes in OOP (Python)`
- `Object:` A combination of data (attributes) and functionality (methods). It is an instance of a class.
- `Method:` A function that belongs to an object and defines its behavior. Methods operate on an object’s attributes.
- `Attribute:` A variable that stores data about an object. Attributes define an object’s state.

- `Class` is basically a blueprint for generating objects.

- `Constructor` -> `initialisng an object.`
> - A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize an object when it is created.
> - In Python, the constructor method is called `__init__().`
> ```
> class Car:
>    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):   # Constructor
>        self.brand = brand
>        self.model = model
>        self.year = year
> ```


With Class[`blueprint`], we can generate many objects as we can

## **`PACKAGE:`**

A package is a folder that contains multiple modules (Python files). It is a way to organize related modules (Python files) into a structured directory. It allows better code organization, reusability, and modularity.

`Why Use Packages?`
- Organizes code into logical modules.
- Avoids naming conflicts by grouping related functionality.
- Enhances reusability by allowing modular imports.
- Supports large-scale projects by structuring code efficiently.
