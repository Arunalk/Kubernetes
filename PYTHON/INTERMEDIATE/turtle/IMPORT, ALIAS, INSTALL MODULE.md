object = <module-name>.<class-name>()
```

### `from import:`

```
from <module-name> import <class-name>
object = <class-name>()

```
from <module-name> import *  
method_name()
```

# <span style="color:lightblue;"> Installing a module </span>

- ðŸ“Œ **`Why Do Some Modules Need to Be Installed While Others Can Be Imported Directly?`**

    - Some modules come `pre-installed with Python` because they are part of the Python Standard Library. You can import them directly without installing anything. 
    - While some modules are `not included` in Python by default. These are developed by third parties and must be installed separately using `pip`.

- A virtual environment in Python is an isolated workspace where you can install packages without affecting the global Python installation. </br>
This allows you to manage dependencies separately for different projects.
