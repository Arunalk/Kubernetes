# Shell Access or Terminal Access for Docker Containers

To interact with a running Docker container, you can gain **shell access** to execute commands inside the container's environment.

```
docker exec -it <container-id> sh
```

## What is a Shell?

A **shell** is a command-line interface (CLI) used to interact with the operating system. It allows users to:

- **Execute commands**.
- Manage processes.
- Navigate the file system.

In Docker, the shell allows you to run commands inside the container, inspect logs, and manage applications running within it.

## Why Use Shell Access in Docker?

Shell access provides several benefits, including:

- Running commands directly inside the container.
- Installing packages or making changes to the container's environment.
- Inspecting files, logs, or container configurations.
- Debugging or troubleshooting issues inside the container.
