# üß© Amazon VPC CNI Plugin ‚Äì Components & Workflow

Amazon VPC CNI is a Kubernetes CNI plugin specifically built for Amazon EKS. It assigns **VPC-native IP addresses** to pods, enabling direct and low-latency communication with AWS services and other pods.

---

## üì¶ Components

### 1. CNI Binary
- A lightweight binary that runs on the node‚Äôs **root file system**.
- **Invoked by the kubelet** whenever:
  - A new Pod is added.
  - An existing Pod is removed.
- Responsibilities:
  - Set up the **Pod's network namespace**.
  - Create **veth pairs** for connectivity.
  - Assign an **IP address** from a warm pool.

### 2. ipamd (IP Address Management Daemon)
- A **long-running daemon** on each node.
- Responsibilities:
  - Manage **ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces)**.
  - Maintain a **warm pool of available IP addresses or prefixes**.
  - Pre-allocate resources to speed up Pod startup.

## üîÅ How It Works

### 1. Primary ENI
- When an EC2 instance (node) is launched, a **primary ENI** is automatically attached.
- It gets its IPs from a **primary subnet**, which can be public or private.
- Pods using `hostNetwork: true` will share the **primary ENI's IP** and network namespace.

### 2. Warm Pool Allocation
- ipamd automatically allocates a **warm pool** of:
  - IP addresses (default mode), or
  - Prefixes (when **prefix delegation** is enabled).
- These are pulled from the subnet associated with the ENI.
- Warm pool helps reduce **latency** by keeping IPs ready for fast assignment.

### 3. Secondary ENIs
- When the **primary ENI** runs out of available IPs:
  - ipamd attaches additional **secondary ENIs** to the node.
  - Each ENI supports a limited number of IP addresses or prefixes (depends on **instance type**).
- More ENIs are attached as needed, up to the **ENI limit** of the instance.

### 4. Pod IP Assignment
- When a new pod is scheduled:
  - kubelet calls the CNI plugin.
  - CNI plugin requests an IP from ipamd.
  - ipamd allocates an IP from the **warm pool**.
  - The pod is connected to the VPC via a veth pair and becomes network ready.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pod IP Allocation Flow

```text
Pod scheduled on Node
      ‚Üì
kubelet invokes CNI binary
      ‚Üì
CNI calls ipamd for available IP
      ‚Üì
ipamd assigns IP from warm pool
      ‚Üì
CNI sets up Pod's network namespace
      ‚Üì
Pod is network-ready with VPC-native IP
