## 📖 RDS Read Replicas

### 🚀 Purpose

Read Replicas are **read-only copies** of a primary RDS instance designed to:

- Improve **performance** by **offloading read queries** from the primary database
- Enhance **durability** and **availability**
- Support **global applications** by placing replicas in different regions

---

### 🔁 How It Works

- **Asynchronous replication** is used between the primary and read replica.
- A **snapshot of the primary** instance is taken to create the replica.
- Any **write/update** operations still go to the **primary**, while **read operations** can be directed to replicas.
- **Multiple replicas** can be created from a single primary instance.

|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Replication Type            | Asynchronous                                                               |
| Read Traffic Handling       | Offloads read queries from the primary                                     |
| Creation Mechanism          | Snapshot of primary instance                                               |
| Write Capability            | ❌ Not allowed (read-only)                                                  |
| Multi-AZ Compatible         | ✅ Can create read replicas of Multi-AZ primary                             |
| Cross-Region Replication    | ✅ Supported — improve latency and availability for global applications     |
| Promotion Capability        | ✅ Can **promote** read replica to standalone DB (e.g., during failover)     |
| Backup Requirement          | Automated backups **must be enabled** on the primary to create a replica   |

---

### 🛠️ Use Cases

- Applications that perform **heavy read operations**
- **Disaster recovery** planning (promote a replica if primary fails)
- Deploying read replicas in **different AWS regions** for global apps
- **Scaling** read-heavy workloads without impacting the primary DB

---

> **Note**: Once a read replica is **promoted**, it becomes a **standalone database** and is **no longer linked** to the original primary.


## 🔁 Multi-AZ Read Replicas

### 🔷 What Is It?

A **Multi-AZ Read Replica** is a **read-only replica** of a primary RDS instance that itself runs in **Multi-AZ configuration**.  
This means the replica has:

- A **primary read replica** (used to serve read traffic)
- A **standby read replica** in another Availability Zone for **failover and high availability**

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

- The **primary RDS** asynchronously replicates data to the **Multi-AZ Read Replica**.
- Within the Multi-AZ replica setup, **synchronous replication** ensures the read replica has a standby for high availability.
- If the read replica's primary fails, it will **failover to the standby**, just like a regular Multi-AZ instance.

### 🧠 Key Benefits

| Feature                     | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Read Scalability            | ✅ Offloads read traffic from the source DB                                 |
| High Availability           | ✅ The read replica has its own standby instance                            |
| Failover Support            | ✅ In case the read replica's primary fails, traffic moves to the standby   |
| Replication Type            | Asynchronous from source DB, synchronous within Multi-AZ replica            |
| Promotion Capability        | ✅ Can be promoted to standalone Multi-AZ DB if needed                       |

### 📝 Summary

- You get the **performance benefits** of read replicas.
- You get the **availability and fault tolerance** of Multi-AZ.
- Ideal for **read-heavy**, **mission-critical** applications.

> 🔒 Ensure that **automated backups** are enabled on the source DB to use read replicas.
