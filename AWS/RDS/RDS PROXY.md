## 🛡️ RDS Proxy

### 🚀 What is RDS Proxy?

**Amazon RDS Proxy** is a **fully managed, serverless, and highly available** database proxy for RDS and Aurora.  
It improves **performance, scalability, and security** of applications by managing database connections more efficiently.

### 🔧 Key Features

- **Connection Pooling**:
  - RDS Proxy maintains a pool of established connections.
  - When a request comes in, it reuses an existing connection if available.
  - Reduces the overhead on the RDS instance, especially during traffic spikes.

- **Scalability**:
  - Helps applications scale without exhausting database connection limits.
  - Suitable for apps with unpredictable or bursty workloads.

- **Improved Security**:
  - Acts as a **barrier between the application and the database**.
  - Supports **IAM database authentication**, removing the need to store credentials in code.

- **Connection Caching**:
  - Supports limited caching behavior by maintaining connections and session state.
  - Reduces repeated overhead for common operations.

|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Connection Management | Avoids connection flooding on the database during high load               |
| High Availability     | Fully managed and fault-tolerant                                           |
| Enhanced Security     | Supports IAM and Secrets Manager for secure authentication                |
| Better App Performance| Reduces time spent opening and closing database connections               |

### 🧠 How It Works

1. Application sends database requests to RDS Proxy instead of RDS directly.
2. RDS Proxy checks if there’s an existing connection in its **connection pool**.
3. If available, it uses that connection. Otherwise, it creates a new one to the RDS database.
4. In case of RDS failover, proxy can **reroute traffic with minimal disruption**.

> **Best Practice**: Use RDS Proxy for applications with high connection churn, unpredictable load, or security-sensitive environments.
