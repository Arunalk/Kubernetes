# **PORT FORWARDING**
 

### **IN DOCKER**

```
docker run -p 8080:80 nginx
```

### **IN KUBERNETES**

```
kubectl port-forward <pod-name> <local-port>:<pod-port>
```

`port-forward bind to 0.0.0.0`
```
kubectl port-forward <pod-name> <local-port>:<pod-port> --address 0.0.0.0
```

>`Why?`</br>
By default, when you use kubectl port-forward, it binds to localhost (127.0.0.1), making the service accessible only from the local machine. If you want to make the service available on all network interfaces, including external ones, you can use the --address option.

**How it Works:**

`IN DOCKER`
- A user makes a request to http://localhost:8080 (host-port).
- Docker intercepts the request and forwards it to port 80 inside the container.
- The application inside the container (e.g., an Nginx server) processes the request and sends a response.
- Docker sends the response back through the same mapped port (8080 on the host).

    > `User ‚Üí Host-Port (8080) ‚Üí Docker Container Port (80) ‚Üí Application inside the container.`

`IN KUBERNETES`

- User sends a request to localhost:8080.

- kubectl port-forward tunnels traffic through the Kubernetes API Server.

- The request reaches the correct pod on port 80 inside the cluster.

- The application processes the request and sends the response.

- Response goes back through the API Server ‚Üí reaches the user's browser or terminal.

    > `User ‚Üí Local Port (8080) ‚Üí Kubernetes API Server ‚Üí Pod Port (80) ‚Üí Application`


## **WHY PORT FORWARDING IS NOT RECOMMENDED**

### **IN DOCKER:**

1. **Security Risks üö®**

    Exposing Services to the Public: If you bind a container‚Äôs port to 0.0.0.0, it becomes accessible from anywhere on the internet, making it a security risk.
    Potential Unauthorized Access: If proper firewall rules or authentication aren‚Äôt in place, attackers can directly interact with exposed services.

2. **Performance Issues üöÄ**

    NAT Overhead: Docker uses Network Address Translation (NAT) for port mapping, which adds overhead and can slow down performance compared to direct network communication.
    Extra Network Layer: Port forwarding involves an additional layer of abstraction that could introduce latency.

3. **Lack of Scalability üìà**

    Port Conflicts: If multiple containers need the same port, you have to manually assign different host ports, which can get messy (e.g., -p 8080:80, -p 8081:80, etc.).
    You would have to manually map each container‚Äôs port to a different host port


### **IN KUBERNETES:**

1.  **Security Risks üîê**

    Exposing Internal Services Unintentionally
    Port forwarding allows access to pods that are meant to be private.
    If misused, sensitive internal services (databases, admin panels) can be accidentally exposed.

2. **No Load Balancing or High Availability ‚öñÔ∏è**

    Traffic only reaches one pod. If you have three pods behind a Service (svc/my-app), kubectl port-forward only connects to one pod.

3. **Performance Issues üê¢**

    Port forwarding is not optimized for high traffic.
    If large amounts of data flow through kubectl port-forward, it can cause:
    `High CPU usage on the Kubernetes API server.`

4. **Temporary and Non-Persistent ‚è≥**
    The port-forward command only runs as long as your terminal is open.
    If you close your terminal or lose connection, the port-forwarding stops instantly.


**WORKING OF NAT GATEWAYS:**

`NAT in Docker Networking` üê≥

When you use port mapping (-p host-port:container-port), Docker relies on NAT to translate and route network traffic.

**`How Docker Uses NAT for Port Forwarding?`**

- Docker creates a bridge network (docker0) by default.
- When you run docker run -p 8080:80 my-app, Docker sets up NAT rules:
Traffic from localhost:8080 is translated and forwarded to container-ip:80.
- The container does not have a public IP, so the host handles external traffic.
Behind the scenes, Docker uses iptables and NAT rules to achieve this.

üîπ `Why is this a problem?`

NAT introduces extra processing overhead (performance hit).
You need to manage port mappings manually (-p 8080:80, -p 8081:80 for multiple containers).

`NAT in Kubernetes (Cloud Deployments)` ‚òÅÔ∏è

- In Kubernetes, NAT gateways play a role in cloud-based clusters, especially for pods in a private subnet.

**`How Kubernetes Uses NAT Gateways?`**

- Kubernetes pods are usually assigned private IPs (e.g., 10.0.0.x).
- `If a pod needs internet access, it can‚Äôt directly route traffic because it doesn‚Äôt have a public IP.Instead, it goes through a NAT Gateway, which:`
- Translates the private pod IP (10.0.0.x) to the public NAT Gateway IP (52.x.x.x).
- Routes traffic to the internet.
- Receives responses and maps them back to the original pod.


**USE CASES OF PORT FORWARDING**

1. Debugging applications
2. Testing new deployments


**BETTER ALTERNATIVES FOR PORT FORWARDING**

1. `NodePort:`

- A NodePort is a type of Kubernetes Service that exposes a pod on a `fixed port (30000-32767) on every node in the cluster`.
This allows external users to access the application using Node‚Äôs IP and the assigned NodePort.

    `How to access service`

    > `curl http://<node-ip>:nodeport`</br>

    `Traffic Flow`

    ```
    üåç User ‚Üí NodePort (on Node) ‚Üí ClusterIP[port] ‚Üí Pod[containerPort/targetport]
    ```


    üîπ **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

    User requests `http://<Node-IP>:<NodePort>`

1. The request reaches any node in the cluster. NodePort service receives the request
`The NodePort service is open on every node in the cluster`.</br>
The request is forwarded to the ClusterIP service.

2. ClusterIP service routes the request to the correct pod.</br>
`The ClusterIP is an internal service that distributes traffic to pods`.[more like load balancing between pods present inside a single node]
It selects a healthy pod and forwards the request.

3. Pod processes the request and sends the response back

    The response follows the same path back through the ClusterIP ‚Üí NodePort ‚Üí User.

    `Drawbacks of using NodePort`

    > 1. `Security Risks` üîê</br>
    NodePort exposes a port on every node, making it more vulnerable to attacks.
    Any user who knows the Node IP + NodePort can access the service directly.</br>
    > 2. `Fixed Port Range (30000-32767)` üéØ</br>
    You cannot use well-known ports like 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).
    Port conflicts can happen if multiple services try to use the same NodePort.
    üîπ Example Problem:</br>
    If Service A uses NodePort: 30080, you cannot use the same port for Service B. 
    > 3. `No Load Balancing Across Nodes` ‚ùå</br>
    NodePort does not distribute traffic between nodes.
    Traffic can get unevenly distributed if users only access a single node‚Äôs IP.
    üîπ Example Problem:</br>
    In a 3-node cluster, if users always hit Node1:30080, only pods on Node1 receive traffic, while pods on other nodes stay idle.
    This creates traffic imbalance and wastes resources.</br>

</br>

2. **`LoadBalancer Service in Kubernetes`**

- **LoadBalancer** is a type of Kubernetes Service that exposes an application externally using a cloud provider‚Äôs load balancer. It automatically provisions an external IP and routes traffic to the appropriate pods.

---

`How to Access the LoadBalancer Service`

```sh
curl http://<external-ip>:<port>
```

`Traffic Flow`
> If target gropup type is `Instance`
```
üåç User ‚Üí LoadBalancer (External IP) ‚Üí NodePort ‚Üí ClusterIP ‚Üí Pod
```
> <span style="color: #E6E6FA;">ClusterIP [virtual IP address assigned to a service] is still part of the traffic flow because all Kubernetes services (LoadBalancer, NodePort, and even Ingress) internally use ClusterIP as the destination for routing requests to pods.</span>
</br>
> `Who Actually Distributes Traffic to Pods?`
> - The kube-proxy is the main component responsible for distributing traffic across pods within a service.
> - It maintains iptables (or IPVS) rules that direct traffic from the ClusterIP to the correct pod based on round-robin (default) or other strategies.
> - So when a request reaches the ClusterIP, kube-proxy selects a pod and forwards the request to it.

`Step-by-Step Breakdown:`

1. **User requests** `http://<external-ip>:<port>`.  
2. `Cloud Provider‚Äôs LoadBalancer receives the request` and forwards it to a node in the cluster.  
3. `NodePort Service (on the node) handles the request` and forwards it to the internal ClusterIP service.  
4. `ClusterIP service selects a healthy pod` and routes the request to it.  
5. `The pod processes the request` and sends the response back via the same path.  

---

`How Does Traffic Flow with target-type=ip?
üìå When a request comes to the ELB:`
```yaml
üåç User ‚Üí ELB (External IP) ‚Üí Target Group (Pod IPs) ‚Üí Pod
```
- ELB directly selects a healthy pod based on its health checks.
- The request never touches NodePort or ClusterIP‚Äîit goes straight to the Pod IP.
- The Target Group contains only Pod IPs, not Node IPs.
---
> üîπ What Does **`target-type=ip`** Mean?
> - The LoadBalancer sends traffic directly to Pod IPs instead of Node IPs.
> - No NodePort is used‚Äîtraffic doesn‚Äôt go through NodePort before reaching the pod.
> - Lower latency compared to NodePort-based routing.
> - No dependency on kube-proxy for routing inside the cluster.
---

`When using Load Balnacer`</br>`externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster` is required.
> When using AWS ELB with target-type=ip (direct-to-pod routing), externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster ensures that:
> - Traffic can be forwarded to any pod, even if it's on another node.
> - Pods on all nodes can receive traffic, not just the node that received the request.
> - Kube-proxy can load balance traffic across all pods in the service.

---
> üîπ `Why Is AWS VPC CNI Required for target-type=ip?`</br>
> When using AWS Load Balancer with target-type=ip (direct-to-pod routing), AWS VPC CNI (Container Network Interface) is required because:</br>
> - It assigns real VPC IPs to Pods, allowing them to be directly routable.
> - AWS ELB can only target IPs within the VPC‚ÄîVPC CNI ensures Pods get IPs from the VPC subnet.
> - Traffic can bypass NodePort and kube-proxy, reducing latency and improving performance.
---

**`Advantages of LoadBalancer Service`**

‚úÖ **Automatic External IP** üåç  
- Kubernetes automatically assigns an external IP via the cloud provider.  
- Users can access the application without needing to know node IPs.  

‚úÖ **Better Load Balancing** ‚öñ  
- LoadBalancer distributes traffic across multiple nodes, preventing uneven load.  
- Helps scale applications by routing requests to healthy pods.  

‚úÖ **Simplified Access** üîó  
- No need to manually manage node IPs and ports.  
- Ideal for production environments.  

---

## Drawbacks of LoadBalancer Service  

üö® **Cloud Provider Dependency** ‚òÅ  
- Requires a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) that supports external load balancers.    

üí∞ **Cost** üí∏  
- Each service should have it's own load balancer.

üìå **Limited Port Configuration** üéØ  
- Only supports a single external port per service.  
- For multiple services, multiple LoadBalancers may be required, increasing costs.  
---

`When to Use LoadBalancer?`
- When you need **`external access`** to your application.  
- When running in a **cloud provider-managed Kubernetes cluster** (EKS, GKE, AKS).  
- When you need **`automatic load balancing across nodes`**.  
---

### **`Ingress in Kubernetes**`

An **Ingress** is a Kubernetes API object that manages **external access to services inside the cluster**. It provides **HTTP(S) routing** based on hostnames or paths and allows multiple services to be accessed through a **single LoadBalancer**.  

---

**`How to Access the Ingress Service**`
Once an Ingress is set up, users can access services using a **domain name** instead of an IP address.  

```yaml
curl http://example.com
```
---
**`Traffic Flow`**  

```yaml
üåçUser ‚Üí Ingress (Ingress Controller) ‚Üí Service (ClusterIP) ‚Üí Pod 
```

### **üîπ `Step-by-Step Breakdown`**  
1. **User requests** `http://example.com`.  
2. **DNS resolves `example.com` to the Ingress Controller‚Äôs external IP**.  
3. **Ingress Controller receives the request** and checks its rules.  
4. **Ingress routes the request to the correct Kubernetes Service** (based on hostname/path).  
5. **ClusterIP forwards the request to kube-proxy**, which selects a **healthy pod**.  
6. **Pod processes the request** and sends the response back.  
7. **The response follows the same path back: Pod ‚Üí ClusterIP ‚Üí Ingress Controller ‚Üí User**.  

---

### **`Advantages of Ingress`**  

‚úÖ **Single LoadBalancer for Multiple Services** üåç  
   - Unlike `LoadBalancer` services, which require **one cloud load balancer per service**, Ingress can route **multiple services through one LoadBalancer**.  

‚úÖ **Host-Based & Path-Based Routing** üè∑  
   - Route different URLs to different services:  
     ```txt
     http://example.com/api   ‚Üí Service A  
     http://example.com/web   ‚Üí Service B  
     ```

‚úÖ **SSL Termination** üîê  
   - Ingress can handle **TLS termination** (HTTPS), so apps don‚Äôt need to manage SSL certificates individually.  

‚úÖ **Better Security & Access Control** üîí  
   - Supports authentication, IP whitelisting, and rate-limiting via annotations.  

‚úÖ **Rewrite & Redirect Support** üîÑ  
   - Modify requests before forwarding them to services.  

---

## **Drawbacks of Using Ingress**  

üö® **Requires an Ingress Controller** üõ†  
   - Unlike `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` services, Ingress doesn‚Äôt work **out of the box**‚Äîyou need to install an **Ingress Controller** (e.g., Nginx, AWS ALB, GCE Ingress).  

üí∞ **Complex Configuration** ‚öô  
   - Requires **YAML configuration** for routing rules.  
   - More complex than simple `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` services.  

‚ö° **Not Suitable for Non-HTTP(S) Traffic**  
   - Ingress **only works for HTTP/HTTPS**.  
   - For other protocols (e.g., TCP/UDP), use **LoadBalancer** or **NodePort** instead.  

---
### **üöÄ `When to Use Ingress?`**  
- You need **`single entry point`** for multiple services.  
- You want to use **`domain-based or path-based routing`**.  
- You need **`SSL termination`** at the Kubernetes level.  
 
>       - SSL termination means the LoadBalancer or Ingress Controller decrypts HTTPS traffic before forwarding it to backend services.meaning redirects https to http
- You want to reduce **`the number of LoadBalancers`** and save costs.  
---
üîπ `Two Scenarios for LoadBalancer with Ingress`

#### 1. `LoadBalancer Targets Pod IPs (Direct-to-Pod Routing)`
>       - No need for ClusterIP or NodePort
>       - LoadBalancer sends traffic directly to pod IPs
>       - Requires AWS VPC CNI (so pods get VPC IPs)</br>

`üìå Traffic Flow (Without NodePort or ClusterIP)`
```yaml
üåç User ‚Üí LoadBalancer (External IP) ‚Üí Ingress Controller (Pod IP) ‚Üí Application Pod
```
#### 2. `LoadBalancer Targets Node IPs (Uses NodePort and ClusterIP)`
>       - ClusterIP and NodePort are needed
>       - LoadBalancer sends traffic to NodePort, which forwards it internally
>       - Works with any CNI (Flannel, Calico, etc.)

`üìå Traffic Flow (With NodePort and ClusterIP)`
```yaml
üåç User ‚Üí LoadBalancer (External IP) ‚Üí NodePort ‚Üí Ingress Controller (ClusterIP) ‚Üí Application Pod
```

> - ELB targets NodePort on worker nodes.
> - NodePort forwards traffic to Ingress Controller Service (ClusterIP).
> - ClusterIP sends traffic to an available Ingress Controller pod.
> - Ingress routes it to the correct backend service.

---

## 2. `ClusterIP:`

- A **ClusterIP** is the default type of **Kubernetes Service** that **exposes a service within the cluster only**.  
  It assigns a **virtual internal IP (ClusterIP)**, making the service accessible **only from within the cluster**, not externally.  

### `How to access the service`

> A ClusterIP service can only be accessed from within the cluster:  
> ```sh
> curl http://<cluster-ip>:<service-port>
> ```

### `Traffic Flow`

```yaml
üåç User (Inside Cluster) ‚Üí ClusterIP[port] ‚Üí Pod[containerPort/targetPort]
```

---

### üîπ **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Internal Service Request:** A pod inside the cluster sends a request to `http://<ClusterIP>:<ServicePort>`.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **ClusterIP Service Receives the Request:**  
   - The ClusterIP service acts as a **virtual internal load balancer**.  
   - It forwards the request to one of the backend pods in the service.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Kube-Proxy Selects a Healthy Pod:**  
   - **Kube-Proxy** uses **round-robin or other load-balancing algorithms** to pick a pod.  
   - If multiple pods are running in different nodes, **ClusterIP can distribute traffic across them**.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Pod Processes the Request & Responds:**  
   - The selected pod processes the request and sends the response back via **ClusterIP**.  

---

### `Drawbacks of using ClusterIP`

> 1. **`No External Access` ‚ùå**  
>    - ClusterIP services **cannot be accessed from outside the cluster**.  
>    - They are designed for internal communication only.  
>
> 2. **`Dependent on DNS Resolution` üåê**  
>    - ClusterIP services are usually accessed using **DNS names (`service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local`)**.  
>    - If DNS resolution fails, services may become inaccessible.  
>
> 3. **`Traffic Stays Within the Cluster` üè†**  
>    - ClusterIP **only allows communication between services within the cluster**.  
>    - To expose a service externally, you need **NodePort, LoadBalancer, or Ingress**.  
>
> 4. **`Potential Load Imbalance` ‚öñÔ∏è**  
>    - **Kube-Proxy distributes traffic across pods, but it's not always perfect.**  
>    - If a node is overloaded, the service **does not automatically balance requests across nodes**.

### üîç `How to Access a ClusterIP Service Externally`

Since ClusterIP is only accessible inside the cluster, you must use 
- Ingress
- Reverse Proxy
- Load Balancer to expose it externally

---

üîç `How to Access a ClusterIP Service Externally (with Traffic Flow)`</br>
Since ClusterIP is only accessible inside the cluster, you must use Ingress, a Reverse Proxy, or a Load Balancer to expose it externally. Below, I‚Äôll explain each method with traffic flow diagrams.

`Accessing ClusterIP via Ingress Controller (Best for HTTP/HTTPS)`</br>
> üìå Scenario: You have a web service running inside Kubernetes as a ClusterIP, and you want users to access it from the internet via a domain name.

üîπ `Traffic Flow:`
```yaml
üåç External User ‚Üí Ingress Controller (External IP) ‚Üí ClusterIP Service ‚Üí Pod (Container)
```

üîπ **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
1. User requests http://my-app.example.com.
2. The request reaches the Ingress Controller, which is exposed via an external IP (34.123.45.67).
3. Ingress Controller checks its rules and forwards the request to the correct ClusterIP service.
4. The ClusterIP service forwards traffic to a healthy pod running the application.
5. The Pod processes the request and sends the response back through the same path.
The response travels back:
```
Pod ‚Üí ClusterIP ‚Üí Ingress Controller ‚Üí User.
```
`Accessing ClusterIP via Reverse Proxy (For Any Protocol)`</br>
> üìå Scenario: You have a ClusterIP service, and instead of using Kubernetes Ingress, you deploy an external reverse proxy (Nginx/HAProxy) outside the cluster to forward traffic.

üîπ `Traffic Flow:`
```yaml
üåç External User ‚Üí External Reverse Proxy (Nginx/HAProxy) ‚Üí ClusterIP Service ‚Üí Pod (Container)
```
üîπ **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
1. User requests http://my-app.example.com.
2. The request first reaches Nginx/HAProxy, which is running outside Kubernetes.
3. Nginx forwards the request to the internal ClusterIP service inside Kubernetes.
4. The ClusterIP service routes the request to one of its backend pods.
5. The Pod processes the request and sends the response back via the same route.
6. The response follows:

```
Pod ‚Üí ClusterIP ‚Üí External Reverse Proxy ‚Üí User.
```

`Accessing ClusterIP via kubectl Proxy (For Debugging Only)`
> üìå Scenario: You‚Äôre outside the cluster and need temporary access to a ClusterIP service using your local machine.

üîπ `Traffic Flow:`

```yaml
üåç External User ‚Üí kubectl Proxy (Local Machine) ‚Üí ClusterIP Service ‚Üí Pod (Container)
```
üîπ **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
1. You run the following command on your local machine (with cluster access):
```
kubectl proxy --address='0.0.0.0' --port=8080 --accept-hosts='.*'
```
2. The proxy runs on your machine, exposing Kubernetes services at http://localhost:8080.
3. User sends a request via the proxy:
```
curl http://<proxy-ip>:8080/api/v1/namespaces/default/services/my-service/proxy/
```
4. The request is forwarded to the ClusterIP service inside the cluster.
5. The ClusterIP service routes the request to a pod.
6. Response is sent back:
```
Pod ‚Üí ClusterIP ‚Üí kubectl Proxy ‚Üí User.
```

### `Why Have a ClusterIP Service If Ingress Directly Uses Pod IPs?`

- Even though Ingress can bypass ClusterIP for external traffic, the ClusterIP service is still useful for internal communication between Kubernetes components.

When Ingress Uses Pod IPs, ClusterIP is Still Useful for:

> 1. `Internal Communication (Pods Talking to Each Other)`
>       - Even if Ingress routes traffic externally, other pods inside the cluster still use ClusterIP for communication.
>       - If ClusterIP didn't exist, every pod would need to know the exact Pod IPs, which constantly change.</br>
        üìå ClusterIP provides stable DNS-based service discovery inside the cluster.
> 2. `Kubernetes Health Checks & Service Discovery
Ingress controllers (e.g., AWS ALB, Nginx) still use the ClusterIP service to discover healthy pods`</br>[***`If the traffic is directly routed to POD IPs then load balancer handles it`***]
>       - Even if Ingress is forwarding traffic directly to Pod IPs, it first queries the ClusterIP service to get the list of available backend pods.</br>
        üìå Without ClusterIP, Ingress would need to manually track pod IP changes.
> 3. `Internal Load Balancing (When Not Using Ingress)`</br>[***`If the traffic is directly routed to POD IPs then load balancer handles it`***]
>       - If another pod needs to talk to your service, ClusterIP is still required.
Example: A microservice setup where service A calls service B:
>       ```sh
>       Service A ‚Üí ClusterIP   Service ‚Üí Pod (Service B)
>       ```
>       - This keeps communication internal, stable, and load-balanced across all pods of Service B.
> 4. `Pod Auto-Scaling & Rolling Updates
Pods are dynamic‚Äîthey get replaced, rescheduled, and auto-scaled.`[***`If the traffic is directly routed to POD IPs then load balancer handles it`***]</br>
>       - ClusterIP ensures that services remain available and stable, even when individual pods restart with new IPs.
>       - Ingress alone doesn't manage service discovery, it relies on Kubernetes to track pods via ClusterIP.

#### üöÄ `Conclusion: Why Keep ClusterIP Even If Ingress Uses Pod IPs?`

| **Function**                         | **Does ClusterIP Help?** | **Why?**                                              |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Internal Pod-to-Pod Communication** | ‚úÖ Yes | Pods inside the cluster need a stable DNS name  |
| **Ingress Controller Pod Discovery**  | ‚úÖ Yes | Ingress still queries ClusterIP to find backend pods |
| **Load Balancing Across Pods**        | ‚úÖ Yes | ClusterIP evenly distributes traffic internally |
| **Service Stability During Scaling**  | ‚úÖ Yes | Ensures services don‚Äôt break when pods restart |

### üöÄ `Why Is Ingress Different from Services?`

| **Feature**        | **Ingress** | **Service (ClusterIP, NodePort, etc.)** |
|-------------------|------------|---------------------------------|
| **Type**         | API object (Not a Service) | Kubernetes Service |
| **Traffic Type** | HTTP/HTTPS | Any (TCP, UDP, HTTP, etc.) |
| **External Access?** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes (Depends on type) |
| **Routing** | Path-based, Host-based | Simple forwarding to Pods |
| **Load Balancing?** | ‚úÖ Yes (HTTP/HTTPS) | ‚úÖ Yes (Depends on type) |
| **Works with?** | ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer | Directly exposes Pods |
