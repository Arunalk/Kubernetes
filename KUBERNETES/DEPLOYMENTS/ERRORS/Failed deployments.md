# Why Kubernetes Deployment Can Fail

---

## 1. Insufficient Quota

**Reason:**  
The namespace or cluster has insufficient resource quotas (CPU, memory, storage), causing the Deployment to get stuck.

**Fix:**  
Request more quota or optimize resource usage to fit within the allowed limits.

---

## 2. Readiness Probe Failures

**Reason:**  
The Readiness Probe is failing due to incorrect configuration or because the application takes too long to become ready.

**Example:**
- The `/health` endpoint returns a 500 error.
- The application is not ready before the readiness probe timeout.

**Fix:**
- Adjust readiness probe settings such as `initialDelaySeconds`, `timeoutSeconds`, and `failureThreshold`.
- Ensure the application's health endpoints are correct and reliable.

---

## 3. Image Pull Errors

**Reason:**  
Kubernetes cannot pull the container image due to:
- Incorrect image name or tag
- Missing image in the registry
- Private registry access issues
- Docker Hub rate limits

**Fix:**
- Verify the correctness of the image name and tag.
- Ensure access permissions for private registries are correctly configured.
- Make sure the image exists and is available.

---

## 4. Insufficient Permissions

**Reason:**  
The Deployment lacks necessary RBAC permissions to access Kubernetes resources like Secrets, ConfigMaps, or APIs.

**Example:**
- Attempting to mount a Secret without the proper access rights.

**Fix:**
- Define the appropriate Roles and RoleBindings.
- Use a ServiceAccount with the necessary permissions to access required resources.

---

## 5. Limit Ranges

**Reason:**  
The Deployment does not specify resource requests and limits, and the namespace has enforced LimitRanges.

**Example:**
- The LimitRange allows a maximum of `cpu: 1`, but the Deployment requests `cpu: 2`.

**Fix:**  
- Specify appropriate resource `requests` and `limits` in the Deployment configuration.

Example YAML:
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
  limits:
    memory: "1Gi"
    cpu: "1"
```
---

## 6. Application Runtime Misconfiguration

**Reason:**  
The containerized application has incorrect environment variables, wrong port configurations, or misconfigured startup scripts.

**Example:**
- Missing essential environment variables like `DATABASE_URL`.
- Application expects a different port than what the Service exposes.

**Fix:**
- Validate environment variables, ports, and configuration settings.
- Review the application's startup scripts and entrypoints for correctness.

# Conclusion

When a Kubernetes Deployment gets stuck, it is often due to issues with quotas, readiness probes, image pulling, RBAC permissions, resource limits, or application configuration.  
Addressing these systematically ensures smooth, reliable deployments and minimizes downtime or production incidents.
